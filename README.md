### Description

This project is a mobile application aimed at facilitating the process of taking pictures and managing them. It allows users to take pictures using their device's camera, save them to a designated album, and view them in a gallery-like interface. Additionally, users can delete saved pictures, view picture details such as location metadata, and configure app permissions.

The application leverages technologies such as React Native for cross-platform development, React Navigation for navigation management, React Native Vision Camera for camera integration, AsyncStorage for local data storage. The project aims to provide a user-friendly experience for managing pictures efficiently on mobile devices.

The use of TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the development process, while Zustand provides a simple and efficient state management solution.
